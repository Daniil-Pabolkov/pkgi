*Means: Package Inspector*

This extension in automatically inspect the compliance of the established packages with the required (in `package.json`).

It does not depend on versions control systems. Can work with several Workspaces. Only root folders with `package.json` fall under observation.

## How does it work

Extension monitors changes in dependencies in `package.json`; updating `package-lock.json`, as well as changes in `node_modules`.

In case of detection of problems, notifies this.

You can also always start a forced check through [command pallete](#Commands)

Also, you can always call the command `Inspector: Check dependencies` for manual run inspection.
